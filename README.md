Time series analysis and forecasting using ARIMA to identify trends, seasonality, and predict future values.
# Time Series Analysis & Forecasting 📈

This project focuses on **time series analysis and forecasting** using statistical techniques to predict future values from historical data.  
The goal is to analyze trends, seasonality, and volatility and build an effective forecasting model.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on time series data
- Identified **trend, seasonality, and noise**
- Applied **ARIMA model** for forecasting
- Evaluated model performance using error metrics

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Statsmodels**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 📊 Methodology
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
2. Visualization of Time Series Components  
3. Stationarity Check using **ADF Test**  
4. Model Identification using **ACF & PACF plots**  
5. ARIMA Model Training  
6. Forecasting & Evaluation
